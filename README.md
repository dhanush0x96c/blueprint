# Blueprint

> Universal project scaffolding — because copy-pasting is not a strategy

Blueprint is a powerful command-line tool written in Go that streamlines project initialization through an intelligent template system with interactive prompts and feature injection capabilities.

## Features

- **Universal Support** - Scaffold projects across any programming language or framework
- **Interactive Prompts** - Guided setup process for seamless project configuration
- **Feature Injection** - Dynamically add features like validation libraries, testing frameworks, and more to your scaffolded projects
- **Template System** - Use built-in templates or create your own custom templates
- **Fast & Lightweight** - Built in Go for maximum performance

## Why Blueprint?

Unlike traditional scaffolding tools, Blueprint's feature injection system allows you to add capabilities to your projects on-the-fly during initialization, giving you the perfect starting point without bloating your codebase with unused dependencies.

## Project Status

⚠️ **Blueprint is in early development and not production-ready.**
